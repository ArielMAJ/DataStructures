# Algorithmic Toolbox

## Week 01

### Code testing sugestion:

- Start with some manual testing and then try them in (possibly) the following order.

- Beware of integer (or other types of) overflow.

- Beware of big inputs and time & space taken to run an algorithm (do time complexity analysis on your solution).

- Beware of edge cases (think what they might be). eg.: minimum size/quantity of input, maximum size/quantity of input, repeated input, etc.

- Stress testing.
        - Implement two or more different solutions to the same problem and compare their outputs to the same, randomly generated, inputs. If the output for a given input should always be the same, the outputs from all solutions should be equal. Meaning this is a good way to find if there's a bug in one of the implementations.

# C & C++ Basics

## Structures

- A collection of similar data items under a name;
- They are used for defining new (user defined) data types;

## Pointers

Pointers store the address of some piece of data and serve as a way to indirectly access them.
It's mostly used to access things that are "external to the program".

Main uses are:
- Acessing heap (dinamically allocated memory -> eg. malloc/alloc);
- Acessing resources (eg. files in hard disk);
- Passing parameters.

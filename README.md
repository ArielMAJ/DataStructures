# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is my repository for practicing data structures and algorithms (mainly with C/C++).

This repository may span multiple DSA courses & learning resources.

## Folder structure

### C0X

These folders contain what I wrote while studying a given course or group of related courses in data structures.

# Have fun!

Feel free to use, explore and suggest things through issues/PRs. Just make sure to write your own code as well when doing courses, that's the only way you'll learn!

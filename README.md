# Data Structures and Algorithms  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/DataStructures/blob/main/LICENSE) 

This is my repository for practicing data structures and algorithms (mainly with C/C++).

This repository may span multiple DSA courses & learning resources.

## Folder structure

### C0X

These folders contain what I wrote while studying a given course or group of related courses in data structures.

# Checkout [test.me](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/test.me)

[test.me](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/test.me) is a command line, open source, tool for testing code that I started developing to facilitate testing my code before uploading to auto-grading tools. Check it out and use it to test my (and also your) data strucutures code. Some of the subfolders in this repository are set up in such a way as to facilitate using this tool for testing it.

# Have fun!

Feel free to use, explore and suggest things through issues/PRs. Just make sure to write your own code as well when doing courses, that's the only way you'll learn!

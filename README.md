# DataStructures
A repository for practicing data structures (mainly with C/C++).


Obs.: A lot of the code here was written while watching tutorials and probably have little variation from what was taught. All the comments should be mine though.

I'll probably be trying to write myself a C++ class that implements each data structure fully.
